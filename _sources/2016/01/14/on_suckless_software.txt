*Warning: this article is not purely technical. Opinions, reasoning and
contradictions are present.*

Conflict of interests is terrible thing. It is very unpleasant, when
there are two principles that you follow and some day you encounter
subject on which they contradict. It happened with me and software.

First, and primary requirement on software must be
`free <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html>`__.
No exceptions. But there is another consideration. With everything else
equal, GPL is better then BSD/MIT/other-non-copyleft-junk. GPLv2+ is
better then GPLv2 and so on. But what about cases, where not everything
else is equal?

Lets compare *GNU Screen (v.4.2.1)* and ``tmux(v2.1)`` -- last released
version at time of writing. Screen is GPLv3+, tmux is BSD-3-clause. On
my personal experience, tmux is slightly simpler to use. Also, it have
feature to number panes starting with 1. Implementing it in Screen is
rather complicated and fragile. With all this, Screen contains 40015
lines of Ansi C code, tmux -- 34859. And in my opinion, tmux codebase is
simpler to understand. Not a dealmaker? Right, read on.

Some time ago I learned about [suckless.org]. It is better to just quote
their philosophy:

.. code::

    Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than
    letting ad-hoc or over-ambitious features obscure the code over
    time.  However one has to pay this price to achieve reliability
    and maintainability.  Furthermore, minimalism results in
    reasonable and attainable goals. We strive to maintain minimalism
    and clarity to drive development to completion.

And I was convinced, that most software I use is really bloated. Lets
continue the terminal multiplexer theme and consider ``dvtm-0.12``,
present in Debian jessie. With configuration at build time, it manages
to deliver same functionality as ``tmux`` or ``GNU Screen``, within 3925
lines of code. Latest version, v0.15 have even **less** lines of code --
3848. One can blame me, that I am too concerned with lines counting. In
other cases I would agree, that ~100 lines difference is nothing. But
let me tell you what was under hood. Version 0.12 implemented what
``tmux`` calls ``copy-mode`` itself -- movement, selection and so on.
Version 0.15 dropped it in favor of pipe: pipe all terminal history to
external process, read it's output and here is paste buffer. Brilliant
solution in unix way.

But real revelation was text editor
`sandy <http://tools.suckless.org/sandy>`__. It is about ~2500 lines of
code, which I can understand within several minutes. I always belived,
that text editor is a beast of extereme complexity, like emacs with over
a million lines of lisp code or vim with 300k lines of C code with load
of conditional compilation. Why the hell support some shitty proprietary
operating system that is not POSIX-complaint? No doubt, suckless
software is not for everyone. By design, it is for advanced users.

Here is contradiction. From my point of view, suckless is really
superior from techincal point of view and inferior from political. What
matters more?

*Here is my answer for myself.* There is nothing wrong with using and
improving free, but not copyleft software, although copyleft one would
be better. Many blame GNU Software for beeing bloated, but let me
advocate us [1]_. GNU is how it all started. Free software started with
GNU Manifesto, Emacs, gcc and gdb. Many GNU projects are first of their
kind in free world. Bash, GCC, Screen, GDB, Coreutils -- they all was
first, and it is hard to be first. Every subsequent project was able to
use wisdom of it's ancestors mistakes. GNU mistakes. History is never
kind to us.

And there is another consideration. GNU's priority is freedom of
users.  And most of them will never write a line of C. If you ever set
up a GNU/Linux system for a person, who can't even invoke ``apt-get
install`` in command line, you know that is is much, much harder, than
setup for yourself. GNU, and many other "bloated" programs attempts to
make happy as much non-programmers, as possible. It has it's price,
huge price, that suckless project refuses to pay. I no longer beleive
that one day everyone will be GNU/Linux hacker, so there always will
have to be someone to pay this price.

I take my hat off to developers, who is proficent with command line
and scripting, but still volonter developing projects like Evolution,
Dolphin or Gmpc. Sorry, but I do not have willpower to develop
something I will not use. All I can do is diplomacy and release
everything I create under GPLv3+.

   After all, I consider myself member of GNU, although I was not too
   active recently.
