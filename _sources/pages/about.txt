Hello! My name is Dmitry Bogatov and here is my place in Web;
just static pages â€” no damned javascript, no stupid
"web-applicatiions", no tracking, no cookies. I did my best to
eliminate every piece of JavaScript, even `free
<https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html>`_ one, but browsing
with JavaScript disabled is always good idea. I recommend `w3m
<https://w3m.sourceforge.net>`_ browser.

Who am I?
=========

* Free Software programmer, supporter and, to some extend, activist.
  Everything I develop myself is license under GNU GPLv3+.  I do not
  install any non-free software. No proprietary drivers, too!
  Unfortunately, JavaScript is another, painful story.

* Teacher. I post-graduated at Moscow State University, Faculty of
  Mechanics and Mathematics, and currently make my living teaching
  mathematics and programming private lessons for school and graduate
  students. I have to admit, that none of my programming students
  became Free Software contributors, as far as I know.

* `Esperantisto <https://en.wikipedia.org/Esperanto>`_. I would not
  say I do much for movement, but I do speak esperanto, take part in
  events and do my best to convey thought, that there is still no
  international general-purpose language. English is fine between us,
  programmers, but by no means is general-purpose.

What else do I support?
=======================

* Privacy. Privacy is important. For some time I did my best to
  anonymous and not have network identity. Unfortunately, this
  closed-world assumption did not work well for me. Too few of us
  remember, that the main and the only true communication method is
  email. But I still reject all those proprietary message programs,
  browse over Tor, block tracking and use different for different
  websites and do my best to share as little of my private
  information, as possible.

* Anarchy and human rights. Probably, my anarchist stance is not
  steady enough, but I do oppose every compromise in favor of
  "interests of state" or "state security". I want something (state,
  for example) to protect me from murder and robbery; I will take care
  of rest.

* Vegetarianism. Current state of ethics consider the life of ultimate
  value, and I can't agree more. Well, life of human being, but can
  you prove that life of *any* human being is more valuable then life
  of, let's say, a cow?... As such, I do not permit meat in my home.

* Minimalism. I dislike photos, toys, souvenirs, pictures and other. I
  dislike bloated software.
