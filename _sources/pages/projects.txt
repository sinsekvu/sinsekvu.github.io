Projects
========

Here is incomplete lists of software I developed or contributed to.

Cdist
-----

`Cdist <http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/>`_ is
configuration management system. It allows me to write simple shell
code, describing what system configuration I want some ssh-accessible
system to have, and --- magic --- cdist makes it happen.

I maintain Debian packaging of Cdist,

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/kaction-guest/cdist.git

configuration of my computers

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/kaction-guest/cdist-cfg-v2.git

and ocassionally contribute minor fixes back into upstream [1]_

.. highlight:: none
.. code::

     6d277ef1 New type: __dot_file
     c4c2d45e New type: __hosts
     1875bce5 Add support for guixsd into os explorer
     b1152464 Include relicense agreements
     ffc3451c GPLv3+ relicensing: Ricardo Catalinas
     88ec06d0 new type: __hosts
     7d6990d9 By default, package is not autoremoved, if it either suggested or recommened, but not is dependency for some other.  With this change, either package is dependency of manually installed, either is is subject to autoremove.
     10735ffb Description: Fix spelling in manuals

.. [1]  Yes, I am ashamed of my spelling. But there is no way to change history.

Runit
-----

.. code::

    runit is a collection of tools to provide system-wide service
    supervision and to manage services.  Contrary to sysv init, it not
    only cares about starting and stopping services, but also
    supervises the service daemons while they are running.  Amongst
    other things, it provides a reliable interface to send signals to
    service daemons without the need for pid-files, and a log facility
    with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits.

I took over *runit* Debian package since version *2.1.2-4* from
upstream developer, Gerrit Pape. On path to *runit_2.1.2-9*, which is
now drop-in replacement for sysvinit, there were

* developed two auxiliary debhelpers --- *dh-runit* and *dh-sysuser*,
  to make integration with *runit* as painless, as possible

* made huge mistake, which made transition from *2.1.2-6* to 2.1.2-7*
  require manual tweaking of dpkg files. I am sorry.

* made a lot of lesser errors, bad design solutions and so on.

There is still a lot to do, but after release of Debian 9, I plan to
finally push *runit* into ``Pre-Depends`` of *init* binary package,
make it first-class Debian boot system.

I consider this work my most significant project. My contribution to a
war aganist systemd. I feel sorry that systemd is Free Software. It
feels a bit like a civil war.

Other Debian packages
---------------------

This `QA page
<http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=KAction@gnu.org>`_ will give
an overview of packages I maintain, but do ignore haskell packages ---
I am still listed as uploader, but I am not active on Debian Haskell
Group for at least year.

..
   Document other projects, in particular mmh fork, Guile-Bash, xselectd and
   other.

Undocumented
------------

List of all my repositories can be viewed on `Alioth
<https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/kaction-guest>`_.  Some of them
are referenced in my other blog posts, others... well, feel free to
clone and hack around.
